**#INSURANCE CLAIMS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM**

**#INTRODUCTION**
The insurance claims management system is meant to make it easier to handle, track, and process insurance claims. Its goal is to give an ideal solution for managing and organising claims appropriately. The system focuses on administrators who may modify, update, and track the information in the system (such as claims, policyholders, and so on), ensuring that all information is accurately generated and connected.
